Before starting to fish, open "Settings" and configure your desired options.
If you've enabled food or bait in settings, note that the bot will only activate
 them after 10 and 30 minutes - make sure to apply them manually before launching.

For better understanding into what the bot detects, i recommend enabling the "debug" option.
Press the "Start" button, position your cursor over the fishing area, then press Numpad 5 (default hotkey).
The bot will run continuously until manually stopped, and will automatically reconnect if the server restarts.
To stop fishing, press Numpad 0 (default). All keybinds can be viewed and customized in the "Keybinds" tab.
